/**
 * The desktop shell around the board (CGLAB-168).
 *
 * Kanban stays the centre of the app — this adds the cockpit around it:
 * a sidebar of projects and agent sessions, tabs so a session can be watched
 * without losing the board, and a status bar for the things only the desktop
 * knows (which server it is talking to, whether the socket is live).
 *
 * Two rules shape the implementation:
 *
 * 1. The board is rendered once and never unmounted. Tab switching hides it
 *    with `hidden`, not by swapping it out, so its React state survives —
 *    filters, expanded cards, a half-typed title. A Kanban that reloaded every
 *    time you glanced at a session would cost more than the tabs are worth.
 *    Scroll position is the exception and does not survive: `display: none`
 *    destroys the layout box, and with it scrollTop.
 * 2. `titleBarStyle: 'hiddenInset'` removes the OS title bar, so the window can
 *    only be moved by an explicit drag region. Anything clickable inside that
 *    region has to opt back out, or it silently stops receiving clicks.

            THE TITLE-BAR ROW, and all that is left of it.

            This row WAS the view tab strip. The tabs are gone and the row is
            empty, and it still has to be here: on macOS `titleBarStyle:
            'hiddenInset'` removes the native bar, so without an explicit drag
            region the top edge of the main column cannot move the window at
            all. The sidebar's own top row is a handle too, but only over its
            own width - grabbing the window anywhere to the right of it would
            do nothing.

            Only on macOS. Windows and Linux still draw their own title bar, so
            a row here would stack a second empty one under the real one.

            The left padding is the traffic-light reserve. Collapsed, the
            sidebar rail is 56px against the ~78px the lights occupy from the
            window edge, so this column's top-left corner is underneath them -
            and anything put in this row without the reserve would render under
            the window buttons: unclickable, with the OS window menu opening on
            top of it. Nothing sits here today, which is exactly why the
            reserve is written down rather than discovered again by whatever is
            put here next.

            `pl-8` is 32px, and it is 32 rather than 48 because the rail grew:
            the lights reach ~78px and the rail covers 56 of them, leaving 22 to
            round up. The arithmetic is in sidebarWidth.ts beside the number
            that drives it, and a test pins the pair.

              so this row would be reserving space for buttons that are not over
              it and offering a second handle for a window that already has one.
              Collapsed, the rail is 56px against the lights' ~78px, and
              without this the first control renders underneath them.

              The 36px goes to the terminal, which is the whole reason the git
              panel moved into a button as well.

              And not at all in FULL SCREEN, or with the terminal's tabs on
              screen (e7ad8020). Full screen has no lights and no window to

        <body> - a keyboard user thrown to the top of the document by their own
