 * CGLAB-168: the desktop shell around the board.

 * Two things this file exists to protect. First, the browser must not change
 * at all — the shell renders only when the preload says we are in the desktop
 * app, and everywhere else the board is what it always was. Second, switching
 * tabs must not remount the board: a Kanban that reloads and loses its scroll,
 * filters and expansion state every time you glance at a session is worse than
 * no tabs at all.
