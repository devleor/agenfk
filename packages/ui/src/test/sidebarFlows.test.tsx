/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * The sidebar's Flows entry, which took the Inbox placeholder's slot.
 *
 * The distinction this file exists to hold is the one the Inbox row failed:
 * a nav row that lands on a stated empty state is scaffolding, and Flows is
 * not. It opens the flow editor - the same modal the board's Manage Flow
 * button opens - and leaves you where you were. So the assertions are about
 * the modal appearing and the view NOT changing, which is what separates a
 * real control from a fourth destination.
 *
 * The editor itself is stubbed. Its behaviour has its own suite
 * (FlowEditorModal.test.tsx); what is unverified without this file is the
 * wiring between the sidebar row and the modal's props.
