/**
 * How wide the sidebar may be (107eb297).
 *
 * Two fixed numbers before this: 224 open, 40 collapsed. The request was to
 * drag the edge, with today's width as the floor and some ceiling above it.
 *
 * THE CEILING IS NOT A NUMBER, IT IS A SUBTRACTION, and that is the whole
 * reason this is a module rather than two constants. The sidebar takes room
 * from the terminal, and a terminal pane below 592 px is unusable - 576 px of
 * glyph plus the scrollbar, measured in splitAvailability rather than guessed.
 * The Electron window can be as narrow as 960. So a generous fixed maximum
 * would let somebody drag the sidebar until the terminal is useless on a small
 * window, with nothing on screen explaining why their agent's output started
 * wrapping wrong.
 *
 * The ceiling therefore falls as the window narrows: on 960 it is 368, not the
 * 420 anybody would have typed.
 *
 * WHY THE FLOOR IS TODAY'S WIDTH. It was asked for that way, and it is also the
 * width every string in the tree was truncated against. Letting the sidebar go
 * narrower would re-open a layout that was tuned once and has tests about it.

 * to 56 so the icons can be 18px inside a 40px square button.
 *
 * ITS WIDTH IS NOT FREE, because it funds the reserve in the column beside it.
 * The macOS traffic lights reach ~78px from the window edge and the rail covers
 * part of that, so whatever is left is padded onto the first control of the
 * main column:
 *
 *     78 - 40 = 38, rounded up to 48   (the old rail)
 *     78 - 56 = 22, rounded up to 32   (this one)
 *
 * Those two paddings live as `pl-8`/`pl-12` in AppShell and TerminalTab. Change
 * this number and they have to move with it, or the first tab is rendered under
 * the zoom button - unclickable, with the OS window menu opening on top of it.
 * The test in sidebarWidth.test.ts pins the pair.
